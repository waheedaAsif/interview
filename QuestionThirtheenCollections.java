		// Mostly we are using ArrayList in my current job, but there are other collections Set,Map and
		// list these three are interfaces.
		// List in java provide order and indexed collection which may contain duplicate
		//Set provides unordered collection of unique objects means that set does not store duplicate
		//object.
		//Map provide data structure based on Key and Values and hashing
		//Maps took two object per entry Key and value, key must be unique and values can be duplicate.
		//List allows null elements bcz it allows duplicate values and Set allow just one null element
		//And Map took multiple null values but just one null key.
